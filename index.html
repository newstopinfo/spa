                        <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">When it comes to clothing during the 1940s, solid colors were reserved for clothing like suits, sportswear, and separates. Most of these garments were manufactured from fabrics with conservative colors like brown, ivory, black, gray, and navy. This should come as no surprise considering these colors are still a mainstay in most women’s wardrobes.</p>

                        <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">When brighter colors were incorporated, they were typically classic primary colors. Yellow, red, and blue tones were incredibly popular. So too were soft greens like mint and aqua. Not unlike today, women tended to wear lighter, softer colors during summer months. Pastels were always appropriate for bright spring and summer days.</p>

This is most apparent when looking at fabrics. During the 1940s, synthetic fabrics like rayon, acetate, and nylon were becoming more prevalent and more popular. Rayon was a favorite among women during this decade because it could mimic expensive textiles.</p>

Many women’s dresses from the 1940s were made of cotton because it was a breathable, easy to wear fabric. Suiting separates were typically manufactured from wool or its lightweight counterpart flannel. Tulle or net fabrics were also popular when it came to formal wear, like bridal gowns or prom dresses.<br><br>In 1940s fashion, prints were reserved for casual dresses or daywear. The prints that were used, however, were incredibly vibrant. Floral prints used in clothing during this decade was much more colorful than floral prints that had been seen on clothing from previous decades. Another iconic print from ‘40s fashion was the polka dot print. Many daytime dresses featured small white polka dots boldly emblazoned on a blue, red, or green background.<br></p>

                     <p class="p-3">In addition to florals and polka dots, many prints that we see today were used in clothing from this era. Plaids and ginghams were incredibly common during this era. So too were delicate pinstripes in bold colors. No matter the print, lace trim was a ladylike detail that was common on women’s clothing from the 1940s.</p>

                     <p class="p-3">Gloves are an article of clothing that has been worn since man has been recording history. When archeologists explored the tomb of Tutankhamen, they even found the remnants of a pair of gloves belonging to the ancient pharaoh. Early people mostly wore gloves purely for protection.</p>

                     <p class="p-3">As time wore on, gloves became somewhat of a symbolic item. Texts from the Middle Ages recount Popes and other clergy members wearing gloves made of white silk and adorned with delicate pearls. Gloves made of opulent and exquisite fabric eventually became an accessory worn only by royalty or other high-ranking members of society.&nbsp;</p>

It was during the 17th century, however, that gloves became far more than just a simple accessory in Western society. Victorians were obsessed with social status. Because of this, clothes and accessories worn by both Victorian men and women were carefully chosen to display a “message” about social status in the public realm. Gloves became important objects that hinted at the wearer’s wealth.
</p><p>Wealthy Victorian women often had a household full of servants to complete chores and other forms of labor. Wearing tight-fitting corsets, billowing skirts, and other impractical articles of clothing sent a message to her peers that she didn’t need to concern herself with hard work of any kind. They also kept their pale, soft, and delicate hands covered by gloves to maintain their unsullied appearance. During this era, gloves weren’t just a way to signify social status – they were also a way to hide it. Working-class women could cover their rough, tan hands with gloves to suggest they were of a higher social class than they actually were.</p></div>

                            <p class="mbr-text align-right mb-0 mbr-fonts-style display-7">In an era that was incredibly concerned with etiquette, even the simple act of wearing gloves came with a long list of “rules” that proper women were meant to follow. Victorian etiquette books advised women to “never go out [of the house] without gloves.” Her gloves, however, had to be on her hands before stepping food outside. Buttoning one’s gloves or tying one’s bonnet strings after leaving the house was simply unacceptable. Modest women were expected to be fully covered before entering the public realm.
<br>
<br>Delicate gloves were worn year-round, no matter the weather. They were especially important and formal events like balls or dinner parties. There was special etiquette that revolved around women wearing gloves during meals. Gloves were expected to be taken off during dinner but could not be removed before being seated at the table. One’s gloves were to be placed gently in her lap and then covered by her napkin. After the final course had concluded, women dipped their fingers in a bowl of water, dried them, and then put her gloves back on. The act of putting her gloves back on after dinner, however, had to be done gracefully and under the table so as to not draw unnecessary attention to the act.<strong><br></strong></p>

Because women were expected to wear white or ivory gloves during hot summer months, men had to follow suit. After all, if a man were to take a woman’s gloved hand on a hot summer day, the perspiration on his hands could ruin the delicate material of her gloves. If his gloves were made of a dark leather or fabric, he also had to be careful before holding a woman’s hand, as the dark color could soil the pristine nature of her gloves. With that said, a gloved hand was more appropriate than touching a woman with a cold, ungloved hand.</div>

                                   While gloves were worn for modesty and to symbolize social status, there was another important reason that gloves were an essential accessory during the 1800s. Contagious diseases were rampant in Victorian society, and many feared catching a grave illness when they ventured into public. Gloves acted as a barrier between the outside world and the body. Upper-class women would frequently wash their hands and wear gloves to maintain a healthy lifestyle and reduce the spread of germs within their households.<br><br>While some strict, Victorian ideals had disappeared from society during the Edwardian era, gloves were still a popular fashion accessory. Proper women often wore gloves to social events, especially women in middle and upper-class society. During the day, women wore leather or suede gloves that extended past their forearms. These gloves also typically featured rows of dainty buttons that extended from the wrist to beyond the elbow. Gloves during this time period were also expected to be properly tailored. Wearing ill-fitting gloves indicated you belonged in a lower class in society.<br>
